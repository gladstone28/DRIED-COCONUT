Removing the hard shell from a dried coconut can be made easier with a few simple steps. Here’s an effective method:

### Tools Needed:

- Hammer or mallet
- Screwdriver or a metal skewer
- Bowl (to catch the coconut water)
- Towel (optional for grip)
- Knife (optional for prying)

### Steps:
1. Drain the Coconut Water:

- Locate the three "eyes" on one end of the coconut.
- Use a screwdriver or a metal skewer to poke holes into the eyes.
- Drain the coconut water into a bowl.

2. Crack the Coconut:

- Wrap the coconut in a towel for a better grip.
- Hold the coconut in one hand and use the hammer or mallet to tap around the circumference of the coconut. This tapping helps to weaken the shell.
- Continue tapping until you see a crack forming. Once a crack appears, you can apply more force to break the coconut open completely.

3. Remove the Shell:

- After cracking the coconut into halves, use a knife to separate the meat from the shell. Insert the knife between the meat and the shell and gently pry them apart. If the shell is stubborn, you can tap the back of the knife with a hammer to help loosen the meat.
- Alternatively, place the cracked coconut halves in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 15 minutes. The heat will help the coconut meat contract slightly, making it easier to separate from the shell.

4. Final Cleaning:

- Once the meat is removed from the shell, you can peel off any remaining brown skin with a vegetable peeler or a paring knife if desired.
By following these steps, you should be able to remove the hard shell from a dried coconut efficiently.
